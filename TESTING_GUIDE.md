## Part 4: Advanced Testing

### Testing with Different Session IDs

**To test Mem0 memory across different sessions:**

1. After completing Test 1-8, **note down your session_id** from any response
2. In Postman, go to **Environments** (top-right dropdown)
3. Click **Edit** on your environment
4. Change the `session_id` to a **new UUID** (or delete it to auto-generate)
5. Run Test 9 again - this simulates a new session
6. If Mem0 memory is working, agent should still recall previous conversation

### Manual Session ID Creation

To use a specific session ID:

1. Go to Environments ‚Üí Edit
2. Set `session_id` to any UUID format, e.g.: `test-session-123`
3. All requests will now use this session ID
4. This is useful for debugging specific sessions

---

## Part 5: Monitor Server Logs

### Watch What's Happening Behind the Scenes

Open your terminal where the server is running and watch the logs:

**What to look for:**

1. **Request received:**
```
INFO: 127.0.0.1:12345 - "POST /api/v2/conversations/{session_id}/messages HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
```

2. **Tool calls:**
```
INFO: [Pydantic AI] Processing message in session abc-123...
```

3. **Mem0 operations:**
```
INFO: Saving conversation memory for user: abc-123
INFO: HTTP Request: POST https://api.mem0.ai/v1/memories/ "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
```

4. **Lead capture:**
```
INFO: Capturing lead: name=John Doe, email=john.doe@example.com
```

---

## Part 6: Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "Session not found"
**Solution:**
- Make sure you're using the same `session_id` variable
- Create a new session by changing the session_id in environment variables

### Issue 2: No response from agent
**Solution:**
- Check server logs for errors
- Verify OpenAI API key is valid
- Check if server is still running

### Issue 3: Mem0 memory_client is false
**Solution:**
- Verify `MEM0_API_KEY` is set correctly in `.env` file
- Restart the server
- Run health check again

### Issue 4: Agent doesn't capture lead
**Solution:**
- Use clear purchase intent language
- Try: "I want to buy this bike"
- Make sure to provide valid email format

---

## Part 7: Understanding the Response Structure

### Standard Response Format

```json
{
    "session_id": "uuid-format-string",
    "response": "Agent's text response",
    "products": null,  // Will be populated in future updates
    "lead_created": false  // Will be true when lead is captured
}
```

### What Each Field Means:

- **session_id**: Unique identifier for this conversation
- **response**: The agent's reply to your message
- **products**: List of recommended products (currently null in v2)
- **lead_created**: Boolean indicating if a CRM lead was created

---

## Part 8: Expected Timeline

**Complete test should take about 10-15 minutes:**

- ‚úÖ Part 1 (Import): 2 minutes
- ‚úÖ Part 2 (Environment): 2 minutes
- ‚úÖ Part 3 (Tests 1-10): 8-10 minutes
- ‚úÖ Part 4 (Advanced): 3 minutes (optional)
